Project Description:
In pharmaceutical industry, Design of Experiments is used to evaluate relationship between various input parameters (temperature, agitation rate, time, etc.) and output results, typically purity/impurity profile and yield. Instead of creating an excel table and type every result manually by pharmaceutical researchers, followed by analyzing the data one by one, trying to extract the best conditions for a certain experiment. This process is normally exhausting, and it is not easy to deeply understand the relationship between the output results and input parameters. This project aims to simplify and add automation to the above manual process. The eventual target is to let researchers only worry about typing data into the website. The cleaning and analysis will be carried out by the program and users will get results by clicking the button on the website.

Knowledge to be applied in the project:
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Javascript: Build one website that allows users to input the experiment results for various parameters. Build a second website that can show summary of the results that users provided. At last, build a website for data visualization after analysis

SQL/PostgreSql: Use SQL or PostgreSQL to build databases to store experiments data either collected through website or local csv

Python/Flask/Jinja: Use python to manipulate the data that extracted from the website and use Flask to establish a local server to run the program. Turn the data into json format for visualization

Pandas/SQLAlchemy: Take the input data from user and clean it for analysis. Analyzing the data with pandas or filtering the data according to different parameters

Machine Learning(optional if time allowed): Use machine learning and linear regression to explore the statistical relation between each input parameter and output results
